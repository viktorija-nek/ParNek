The limitations and exclusions in this section apply to the maximum extent permitted by law.


Termination.
You may stop using the Services and Software at any time. Termination of use does not relieve you of any obligation to pay any outstanding fees.
 
Unless stated in any Additional Terms, we may, at any time, terminate your right to use and access the Services or Software if:

	(f) we are required to do so by law (for example, where the provision of the Services or Software to you is, or becomes, unlawful);
	(g) we elect to discontinue the Services or Software, in whole or in part (such as if it becomes impractical for us to continue offering Services in your region due to change of law);

Upon the expiration or termination of the Terms, some or all of the Services and Software may cease to operate without prior notice. Any perpetual licenses you have will continue in full force and effect, however. Your indemnification obligations, our warranty disclaimers or limitations of liabilities, and dispute resolution provisions stated in the Terms will survive.
