You will indemnify us from any claim, demand, loss, or damage, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, arising out of or related to your Content, your use of the Services or Software, or your violation of the Terms.
 
Unless stated in the Additional Terms, the Services and Software are provided “AS-IS.” To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including the implied warranties of non-infringement, merchantability, and fitness for a particular purpose.

Limitation of Liability.
Unless stated in the Additional Terms, we are not liable to you or anyone else for any loss of use, data, goodwill, or profits, whatsoever, and any special, incidental, indirect, consequential, or punitive damages whatsoever, regardless of cause (even if we have been advised of the possibility of the loss or damages), including losses and damages (a) resulting from loss of use, data, or profits, whether or not foreseeable; (b) based on any theory of liability, including breach of contract or warranty, negligence or other tortious action; or (c) arising from any other claim arising out of or in connection with your use of or access to the Services or Software.

The limitations and exclusions in this section apply to the maximum extent permitted by law.


Termination.
You may stop using the Services and Software at any time. Termination of use does not relieve you of any obligation to pay any outstanding fees.
 
Unless stated in any Additional Terms, we may, at any time, terminate your right to use and access the Services or Software if:
 
	(a) you breach any provision of the Terms (or act in a manner that clearly shows you do not intend to, or are unable to, comply with the Terms);
	(b) you fail to make the timely payment of fees for the Services or Software, if any;
	(c) you materially breach any provision of the Terms, and (i) the breach cannot be corrected; or (ii) we notify you of the breach and you fail to correct it within 14 days of the notice;
	(d) you have repeatedly made complaints in bad faith or without a reasonable basis, and continue to do so after we have asked you to stop (in such circumstances, we may alternatively suspend or restrict your access to the Services or Software);
	(f) we are required to do so by law (for example, where the provision of the Services or Software to you is, or becomes, unlawful);
	(g) we elect to discontinue the Services or Software, in whole or in part (such as if it becomes impractical for us to continue offering Services in your region due to change of law);

Upon the expiration or termination of the Terms, some or all of the Services and Software may cease to operate without prior notice. Any perpetual licenses you have will continue in full force and effect, however. Your indemnification obligations, our warranty disclaimers or limitations of liabilities, and dispute resolution provisions stated in the Terms will survive. 

We may modify these General Terms, any Additional Terms or Subscription and Cancellation terms, for example, to reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services or Software. You should look at the Terms regularly. We will post notice of modifications to these General Terms and Additional Terms on this page. By continuing to use or access the Services or Software after the revisions are in effect, you agree to be bound by the revised Terms.
 
We may modify, update, or discontinue the Services or Software (including any portions or features) at any time, without liability to you or anyone else. 
 
You may not assign or otherwise transfer the Terms or your rights and obligations under the Terms, in whole or in part, without our written consent, and any such attempt will be void. We may transfer our rights under the Terms to a third party.
 
Headings used in these General Terms or Additional Terms are provided for convenience only and will not be used to construe meaning or intent.
 
If any provision of these General Terms or any Additional Terms is held invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the General Terms and any Additional Terms will continue in full force and effect. 
 
Our failure to enforce or exercise any provision of the Terms is not a waiver of that provision.
